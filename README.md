-SaaS-FinTech-Product-Funnel-Analysis-
A complete product funnel analysis for a SaaS-based FinTech platform aimed at understanding user progression, identifying drop-off stages, and generating actionable insights using data analysis techniques.


Overview
This project presents an end-to-end product funnel analysis for a SaaS-based FinTech platform. The goal is to understand user progression across the order workflow, identify conversion drop-offs, and generate actionable insights to improve product performance and revenue.

Business Problem
Completed orders are directly tied to revenue for the SaaS FinTech platform. Stakeholders observed a lower-than-expected conversion rate between users who start an order and those who complete it. This analysis aims to determine where users drop out of the workflow and recommend product adjustments to improve conversion.

Methodology
- Extracted, cleaned, and transformed order status data using SQL  
- Built a Power BI dashboard to track orders across funnel stages  
- Conducted funnel analysis in Python to identify high-impact improvement opportunities  

Tools & Skills
- SQL: CTEs, joins, CASE statements, aggregate functions  
- Power BI:DAX, ETL, calculated columns, data modeling, visualization  
- Python:Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, statistics, funnel modeling  

Key Insights & Recommendations
- A large percentage of users drop off before fully entering the workflow  
- Successful bank login attempts are a major conversion bottleneck  
- Improving user interaction and login success rates presents the largest revenue opportunity  

Recommended actions include improved in-product copy, reminder emails and texts, clearer workflow guidance, and better client support.

Outcome
This analysis provides stakeholders with clear visibility into funnel performance, supports data-driven product decisions, and highlights opportunities to increase conversion and revenue.
